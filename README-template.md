## Overview

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process
I started with the html file, adding the font source into the header, dividing the body content into manageable packages, and adding the image above the body text.

Then I methodically went down the line in css, starting with the body (background), then image, header1, and paragraph. I could probably be more organized, though, as I was bouncing around a lot. I should do more pesudocoding.

I had some trouble with the google font. The bolder text didn't look the same as the sample, and I couldn't get it to be any thicker. I solved it by importing the 400 and 700 weight fonts, instead of trying to synthetically thicken the 400 font.

### Built with

VSCode
Google Fonts

### What I learned

I learned how to import fonts, and the idea of different weights.


### Continued development

I'm sure there's a better way to space out the elements in a div than using margins and padding all the time. My knowledge now is very limited, so I feel like I'm doing everything in a roundabout way.
I look forward to streamlining everything as I learn more.

### Useful resources

I knew how to do most of this, but for the few questions I had, W3Schools was a good resource.
